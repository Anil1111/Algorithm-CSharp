# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)

Given a **sorted** array, remove the `duplicates` **in-place** such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

**Do not** allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by `modifying the input array` **in-place** with `O(1)` extra memory.
 
**Example:** 
```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
```
