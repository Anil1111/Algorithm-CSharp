# 27. Remove Element

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/)

Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value **in-place** and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** `in-place` with `O(1)` extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example:** 
```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
```
