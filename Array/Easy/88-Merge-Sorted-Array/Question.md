# 88. Merge Sorted Array

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/)

Given two **sorted** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.

**Note:**
You may assume that `nums1` has enough space (size that is `greater or equal to m + n`) to hold additional elements from `nums2`. 
The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are `m` and `n` respectively.
