# 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/description/)

Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is **rotated** at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

Find the **minimum** element.

The array may contain `duplicates`.
