# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/)

There are two **sorted** arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size m and n respectively.

Find the `median` of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be **O(log (m+n))**.

**Example 1:**
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

**Example 2:**
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
