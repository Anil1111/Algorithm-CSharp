# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/description/)

> We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (`-1`, `1`, or `0`):
 
```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

**Example:** 
```
n = 10, I pick 6.
Return 6.
```
