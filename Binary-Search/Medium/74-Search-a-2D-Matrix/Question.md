# 74. Search a 2D Matrix

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/description/)

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. 
This matrix has the following properties:
* Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
* The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Example:** 
Consider the following matrix:
 
```
[
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
```
Given **target** = `3`, return `true`.
