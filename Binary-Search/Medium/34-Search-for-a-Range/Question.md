# 34. Search for a Range

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-for-a-range/description/)

Given an array of integers **sorted** in `ascending` order, find the `starting` and `ending` position of a given `target` value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of **O(log n)**.

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

**Example:**

Given `[5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]` and `target` value `8`,
return `[3, 4]`.
