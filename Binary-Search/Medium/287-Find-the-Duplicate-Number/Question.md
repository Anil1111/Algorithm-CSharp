# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/)

Given an array nums containing **n + 1** integers where each integer is between `1` and `n` (inclusive), 
prove that at least `one duplicate` number must exist. Assume that there is **only one duplicate** number, find the duplicate one.

**Note:**
1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, **O(1) extra space**.
3. Your runtime complexity should be `less than` **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**.     
4. There is `only one duplicate` number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
