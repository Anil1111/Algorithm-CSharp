# 658. Find K Closest Elements

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/description/)

Given a **sorted array**, two integers `k` and `x`, find the `k` closest elements to `x` in the array. 
The result should also be sorted in **ascending** order. If there is a tie, the `smaller elements` are always preferred.
 
**Example 1:** 
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:** 
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Note:** 
* The value `k` is **positive** and will always be smaller than the length of the sorted array.
* Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 10<sup>4</sup>.
* Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 10<sup>4</sup>.
