# 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/description/)

Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,
the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
