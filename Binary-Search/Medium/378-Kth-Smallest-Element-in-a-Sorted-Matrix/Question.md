# 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/description/)

Given a `n x n` matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in **ascending** order, find the `kth smallest` element in the matrix.

Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

**Example:**
```
matrix = [
   [ 1,  5,  9],
   [10, 11, 13],
   [12, 13, 15]
],
k = 8,

return 13.
```

**Note:**
You may assume k is always `valid`, **1 ≤ k ≤ n<sup>2<sup>**.
