# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is **rotated** at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

You are given a `target` value to search. If found in the array return its `index`, otherwise return `-1`.

You may assume `no duplicate` exists in the array.
