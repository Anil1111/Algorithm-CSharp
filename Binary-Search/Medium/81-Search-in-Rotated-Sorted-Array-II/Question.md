[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/description/)

Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if **duplicates** are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is **rotated** at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

Write a function to determine if a given `target` is in the array.

The array may contain **duplicates**.
