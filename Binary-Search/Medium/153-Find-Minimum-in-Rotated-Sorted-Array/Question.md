# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is **rotated** at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

Find the **minimum** element.

You may assume `no duplicate` exists in the array.
