# 186. Reverse Words in a String II

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-ii/description/)

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. 
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

The input string does **not** contain `leading` or `trailing` spaces and the words are always separated by a `single` space.

**For example:**
Given s = `"the sky is blue"`,
return `"blue is sky the"`.

Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
