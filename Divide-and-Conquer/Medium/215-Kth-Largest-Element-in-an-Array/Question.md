# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

Find the `kth` largest element in an `unsorted` array. 
Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

**Example:** 
```
Example 1:

Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5

Example 2:

Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
```

**Note:**
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length;
You can swap elements in the array

**Challenge:**
O(n) time, O(1) extra memory.
