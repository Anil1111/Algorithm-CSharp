[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

Given _n_ non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

For example,  
Given `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`, return `6`.

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. **Thanks Marcos** for contributing this image!
