# 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters  

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-two-distinct-characters/)  

Given a string s , find the length of the longest substring t  that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

**Example 1:**  
Input: "eceba"  
Output: 3  
Explanation: t is "ece" which its length is 3.  
  
**Example 2:**
Input: "ccaabbb"  
Output: 5  
Explanation: t is "aabbb" which its length is 5.  

**Note:**  
If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string `""`.

If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
