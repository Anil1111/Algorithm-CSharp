# 283. Move zeros
[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while `maintaining the relative order` of the `non-zero` elements.
For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].


Note:
	1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
    2. Minimize the total number of operations.
