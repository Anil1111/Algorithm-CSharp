# 604. Window Sum
[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/description/)

Description
Given an array of n integer, and a moving window(size k), move the window at each iteration from the start of the array, find the sum of the element inside the window at each moving.
 
Example
For array [1,2,7,8,5], moving window size k = 3.
1 + 2 + 7 = 10
2 + 7 + 8 = 17
7 + 8 + 5 = 20
return [10,17,20]

Given a **non-empty** string s, you may delete `at most` one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

```
Example 1:
Input: "aba"
Output: True

Example 2:
Input: "abca"
Output: True
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
```

Note:
The string will only contain lowercase characters a-z. The maximum length of the string is 50000.
