# Lnt144. Interleaving Positive and Negative Numbers  
[Original Page](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/interleaving-positive-and-negative-numbers/description)

Given an array with `positive and negative` integers. Re-range it to interleaving with positive and negative integers.

You are not necessary to keep the original order of positive integers or negative integers.
   
**Example:**

Given [-1, -2, -3, 4, 5, 6], after re-range,   
it will be [-1, 5, -2, 4, -3, 6] or any other reasonable answer.   
   
**Challenge:**
Do it in-place and without extra memory, with O(n) time complexity.
