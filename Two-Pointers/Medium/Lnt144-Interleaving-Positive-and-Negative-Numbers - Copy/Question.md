# 49. Sort Letters by Case  
[Original Page](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/sort-letters-by-case/description)

Given a string which contains only letters. Sort it by lower case first and upper case second.  

It's NOT necessary to keep the original order of lower-case letters and upper case letters.
   
**Example:**

For "abAcD", a reasonable answer is "acbAD"     
   
**Challenge:**
Do it in-place and without extra memory, with O(n) time complexity.
