[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/)

Follow up for `"Remove Duplicates"`:
What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?

**Example:** 
```
Given sorted array A = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, and A is now [1,1,2,2,3].
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
```
Original Question: [(E) 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/):
Given a **sorted** array, remove the `duplicates` **in-place** such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
**Do not** allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by `modifying the input array` **in-place** with `O(1)` extra memory.
