[Original Page](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/partition-array-by-odd-and-even/description)

Partition an integers array into odd number first and even number second.   

It's NOT necessary to keep the original order of odd number and even number.
   
**Example:**

Given [1, 2, 3, 4], return [1, 3, 2, 4]     
   
**Challenge:**
Do it in-place and without extra memory, with O(n) time complexity.
